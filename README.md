This project was an entrance to the data analysis process. Its **main goal** was to _perform analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways_. so we went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing inferences from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies.
